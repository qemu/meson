## Automatically set up Visual Studio environment

When Meson is run on Windows it will automatically set up the
environment to use Visual Studio if it has not been set up
already. This means that you can run Meson commands from any command
prompt or directly from any IDE. Meson automatically sets up the
newest 64 bit VS install. If you need something else, you need to run
the build from the corresponding dev tool command prompt just like
with earlier Meson versions.
